\textbf{Abstract}

% Isi Abstrak
Quadruped robots are increasingly being used in various applications
due to their high mobility and ability to operate in diverse terrains.
However, most commercially available quadruped robots are primarily designed
for mobility and environmental perception without being equipped with actuators for object manipulation.
If a quadruped robot is equipped with a robotic arm and gripper,
manual control becomes a significant challenge,
especially in remote scenarios that require complex operations.
This research aims to develop an autonomous grasping system for quadruped robots with task-level interaction.
The proposed system includes hardware integration of a robotic arm and gripper,
along with a hierarchical control approach that involves approaching the object,
detecting the object, selecting the object, and performing autonomous grasping.
State-of-the-art algorithms such as GraspNet will be implemented to enable the robot
to grasp objects autonomously without direct operator control.
With this system, quadruped robots are expected to interact more effectively with their environment,
expanding their potential applications in areas such as search and rescue, industrial tasks, and exploration of complex environments.
